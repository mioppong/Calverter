# Calverter

This was a small class project, which we had to use our class knowledge to build something. Me and my team built a Calculator/ Converter with a login page. It doesnt save current login information to a file, so when app is closed, username and password are gone


## Getting Started

* Download files and unzip them
* open terminal in directory,


## Running program

open directory these files are in, in the terminal, then 

```
javac RunThisClass.java
java RunThisClass
```


## Future Work
* In the future, I hope to save the usernames, and add more functions
